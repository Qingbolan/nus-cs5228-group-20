- **Visualization and Analysis**:

  - Created visual representations of key data columns' importance.
  - Based analysis on heatmaps and group discussion results.
- **Specific Column Preprocessing**:

  - Took charge of preprocessing for columns: title, make, model, description, manufactured, original_reg_date, and reg_date.

### 2. Model Development and Optimization

- **Model Experimentation**:

  - Implemented multiple machine learning models:
    - LightGBM
    - XGBoost
    - CatBoost
    - Deep learning approach using Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- **Parameter Tuning**:

  - Conducted multiple iterations of random parameter tuning.
  - Aimed to achieve the highest coefficient.
- **Process Improvement**:

  - Identified and proposed the need for unified preprocessing functions for both training and test sets.
- **Kaggle Submission**:

  - Achieved the group's highest Kaggle submission score with an RMSE of 35,000.

### 3. Error Analysis and Improvement

- **Critical Reflection**:

  - Reflected on previous experimental results after receiving feedback.
  - Identified potential issues in preprocessing.
- **Algorithm Redesign**:

  - Independently conceptualized and rewrote the algorithm for handling missing values.
  - Implemented a KNN-based approach to find the most similar data groups.
  - Used median values from these groups to fill in missing data.
- **Script Development**:

  - Created new scripts for cleaned train and test data.
  - Updated the preprocessing script.
- **Performance Improvement**:

  - Achieved a significant RMSE improvement from 35,000 to 22,000.

### 4. Team Collaboration and Infrastructure

- **GitHub Repository**:

  - Proposed and created a GitHub repository to address:
    - Kaggle's daily submission limit (5 times per day).
    - Challenges in managing team methods and code.
- **Data Management**:

  - Developed a script to split the 25,000 training data points:
    - 20,000 for new training data.
    - 5,000 for testing data with corresponding true prediction values.
- **Simulation Script**:

  - Created a Python script to simulate Kaggle competition RMSE calculations.

### 5. Ongoing Optimizations

- **Code Refinement**:

  - Further refined code for various models.
- **Enhanced Preprocessing**:

  - Applied standardization to specific columns.
  - Observed and shared insights on column-specific standardization effects.
- **Feature Selection**:

  - Removed 'make' and 'model' columns post-preprocessing based on heatmap analysis.
- **Performance Achievement**:

  - Led the team to achieve an RMSE of 20,000.
  - Moved from bottom 4 to top 10 among 41 teams.

### 6. Ongoing Contributions

- **Group Discussion Facilitation**:

  - Participated in the second offline group discussion.
  - Organized and shared personal findings.
  - Resolved code execution issues for other team members.
- **Future Planning**:

  - Communicated and aligned on ideas for further improvements in data preprocessing.
